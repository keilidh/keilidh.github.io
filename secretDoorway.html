		<h3>you have traversed beyond the heart's deepest chambers.</h3>

		<p>no soul is two-dimensional as the simply stated "good and evil." for how would we define the light without considering the depth of its shadow? the fruits of the spirit lie in choices to be kind, patient, and sacrificial. but the most profound love is seen through a lens fogged by life's inevitable sorrow. consider whether clarity is marked by absence or elimination. perhaps the impeccable heart is not one which abstains, but rather endures and transcends.</p>
