    <h1>you have chosen love.</h1>
    <p>love is all-encompassing, experienced on a boundless spectrum independently, jointly, and spiritually. love is everywhere, platonically and romantically. it can be found in a glance, a coincidence, and even a selfish act. just as it soothes, love disrupts, and is as much of a question as it is an answer. consider for a moment what kind of love you have sought, and its presence in your life perhaps lost on you.</p>
